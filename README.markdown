# Notes

 *   Settings aren't stored encrypted, don't leave your settings file lying around
 *   Account is the wow account that pops up right after login (eg: http://i.imgur.com/zVAko.png). This can either be text or a number, where text represents the name of the account (eg, WoW1) or a number represents the order in the list (eg, 1 = WoW1 - the 1 doesn't correspond to the 1 in WoW1, it's just WoW1 is first in the list). Use numbers if your account is not in english.
 *   Realm is your characters realm. This can either be a text or a number, where text is the name of the realm (eg, Jubei'Thos) or number is the index of server type (eg, 1 for united states, 2 for oceanic etc) and the order of the server in that list (eg, 2,1 is oceanic jubei'thos). Use numbers if your realm type and/or realm isn't in english.
 *   Character is the name of your character or a number representing the order in the character list. Use a number if your character name isn't in english.
